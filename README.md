# OOP CONCEPT: Hierarchical inheritance
Hierarchical inheritance in Java is a type of inheritance where multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.
This forms a hierarchy with a single root class and multiple subclasses.

In this example, `Livre` and `Magazine` both extends `BibliothequeElement`
